# Schillinger

Python implementation of some Algorithms of Russian-American mathematician
and music theorist Joseph Schillinger. They are descriped in Schillinger books
'The mathematical basis of the arts' and 'The Schillinger System of Musical Composition'.

### Implemented:
  * Synchronisation via the synchronize - function.
  * Synchronisation of the complementary factors via the synchronize_complementary - function
  * Fractionize via the fractionize - function.
  * different Permutations
    * cyclic permutations via the permute_cyclic - funciton
    * general permutations via the permute_general - function
  * Distributive Powers via the distributive_power - function (might be false / different
    from Schillingers original idea)


### Dependencies:
  * sympy
